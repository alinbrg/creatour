					CreaTour - Pursuit of an Aspiration to Shape the Meaning of Our Own
					World and The World We Live In CreaTour is a touristic project
					following forceful currents of modern times that have gone way out of
					traditional understanding of tourist travel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Feeling has become much more widespread that life experience harbours
					much deeper richness in its meaning rather than in its simple sensory
					stimulus, superficial recreation, mere excitement, entertainment and
					fun. At Least for ‘people of certain nature’ there cannot be a true
					sense of completion or fulfillment without connecting with deeper
					life-meanings and human values. This need creates powerful human
					hunger driving the critical evolutionary quest. CreaTour has been
					borne out of the quest for deep life meanings and values that move us
					as humans, individuals and societies and around which the human world
					revolves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Philosophers and thinkers all around the world, through their quest
					for deeper meanings and values, have made “existential contribution
					towards human consciousness” and formation of movements from
					enlightenment and awakening (Budha), self-realisation by seeking
					highest meanings and knowledge (Hindu), self-examination and study of
					outside world (Confucius), exploration of the path to the harmony and
					balance (Tao), primacy of good thoughts, good words and good deeds
					(Zoroaster) to ethics and humanism (Christianity and western
					philosophy) and to current social and political theories that have
					powerfully influenced flow of history and current social and political
					order and affected the lives of each of us in profound ways. This
					quest is a human energy that has a power of such colossal change.
				</p>
				<p>
					CreaTour is an initiative to support and unite like-minded people in
					pursuit of aspiration to shape the meaning of our own world and the
					world we live in. Means of achieving that is traveling through,
					discovering and experiencing the deepest life-meanings by which we are
					wired as humans. Goal is to put together the combination of worldwide
					traveling, social and historic touring and intellectual journeying as
					means of this empowering discovery.
				</p>
				<p>
					CreaTour is devotion to the human desire of gaining new life meanings
					and increasing horizon of consciousness. And because Consciousness has
					a transformative influence on the course of life, this is designed to
					be a transformative experience
				</p>
				<p>
					Rather than being travel experience in its traditionalised sense,
					CreaTour is designed to be a value experience generating fresh and
					authentic insights for deep reflection. Being busy pursuing social and
					individual roles and goals, humans have been suggested or imposed by
					their living environments into current ways and standards of
					consciousness. And, as a result, life often feels like prearranged
					route supposed to be followed rather than the opportunity given to us
					to connect with our own values that lead us to the pursuit of the life
					truly meaningful to us.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a captivating sentiment felt and expressed since ancient
					times, that “Unexamined life is not worth living” (Socrates) and the
					essence of allowing time and space for discovery and reflections is
					proclaimed by every major philosophy and religion worldwide. Indeed,
					it makes so much sense to take a break of our lives for the very
					purpose of searching, clarifying and connecting with life values. And
					what could be a better place, for the start, than changing the
					environment for taking a fresh view!
				</p>
				<p>
					We would not be the first ones to argue that the best way of
					predicting the future is inventing one – creating it; Best way of
					defining ourselves is creating who we want to be rather than
					succumbing to the current flow of life and given “reality” of who we
					are. The whole life in this sense can be an adventurous Journey and
					Tour of Creation – new-meaning creation of the Self and the World.
					Call of this design is to join the march for this high quest - human
					tour of creation - CreaTour.
